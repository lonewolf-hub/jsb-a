console.log("hi");

//variable and constants

var score = 2;
var score = 5;
console.log(score)
//so here we redeclare the same variable score by using var which is not a good practice that may cause issue in the program so to avoid this we can use the another type of variable known as let

let points = 1;
points = 2;
console.log(points);
//here we can see let can't be redeclare but the value can me reassigned or can be changed

const value = 12;

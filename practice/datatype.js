console.log("data types in javascript")

// there are 7 data types in javascript 

//Number 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

//String "here is a string ", "22", "any thing that is made up with more than 1 character we can call it a string"

//Boolean true/false this data type is used and only two value something can either be true or false

//Null we use this data type when we intentionally wants to leave an abscence value

let score = null;

console.log(score)

//Undefined Variable are declared in program but it is not initialised with a value

let newvar ;
console.log(newvar) // so here we can see that there is no value initialized so it will prompt a undefined in the console

//but giving a null value to variable is better coding practice 

// Object Complex data structure 

// Symbol looks like object which is used to define protocols in javascript
